# That Logo Came From The Moon! Entries
Entries and ephemera for the “That Logo Came From The Moon!” redesign contest.  Each entry contains at least an icon, a logo, a wallpaper, and a splash screen — although several contain more than one.

Please avoid using these publicly without:
* Crediting the artist  (Which means, don’t use them publicly until *after* a winner has been announced, since the artists will **not** be revealed before then.) 
* Linking back to solarian.net 
*  Additionally, please do not use non-winning entries to represent Solarian Clan in the community.  

Feel free to use them personally as you see fit.
