# Entry A
**Artist’s Statement:**
I focused on the literal Shadowkeep, and the hive spikey stuff for the logo - and the moon, of course, since that’s where we’ll be mostly working around.

For the wallpaper to use new light’s promo art - with new light coming out well hopefully see another surge in members and it’ll be up to us to show em the ropes.

It’s all gonna be really exciting
