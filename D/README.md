**Artist’s Statement:**
My designs are intended to invoke Vex architecture of the Garden of Salvation using Solarian colors.

I rendered an “S” in Vex architecture for my icon and used our sword in both the logo and icon.

My splash and wallpaper are focused on the Guardians of our clan.  The splash has Guardians of every class, wearing their flashiest armor.  The wallpaper features a Solarian Titan defending the city.
