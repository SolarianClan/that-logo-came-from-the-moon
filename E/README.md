**Artist’s Statement:**
The icon is based on the Bungie shield (with the hand holding a lightning bold, the cross swords, and the 7).  It has an S in the Shadowkeep font and the clan swords and wisps.

The logo is our clan name in Shadowkeep lettering flanked by dark purple crescent moons.

The splash is Eris standing in front of the Shadowkeep itself.  Smoke, in the form of the clan wisps rise from the Keep.

The wallpaper is a high-quality Destiny 2 engine render of the communications station on the Moon from D1.  The color and saturation is punched up so it’s more useable as web and desktop wallpaper.
