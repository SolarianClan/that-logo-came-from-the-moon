**Artist’s Statement:**
These are my Hive worms... terrors from the Moon.   My logo includes the worm“S”, as well as the “o”  in its orbit to evoke the Moon.  My icon includes the “S” worm, with the saltire Solarian swords ajouré.

My Splash Screen features a dramatically lit Solarian Moonbase with the remnants of a Hive structure behind.  My wallpaper plays on the sleeping Vex in the Garden of Salvation.
