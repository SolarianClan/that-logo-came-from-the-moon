# Entry B
**Artist’s Statement:**
I’ve always been partial to minimalist, stylistic imagery and iconography, and I’ve felt for a long while that Solarian could benefit from heading in that direction.  I designed my submission around trying to reimagine Solarian’s identity in that context, while trying to tie it more into the imagery of Destiny and Bungie’s design.
